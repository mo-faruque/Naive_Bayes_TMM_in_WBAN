abstract = {With the development of micro sensors, embedded technologies and wireless networking, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is becoming a key emerging technology in healthcare to monitor and collect the biological data from the human body. Ensuring security of this network from compromised sensor nodes is a challenging task, as the traditional security mechanisms are not suitable and compatible with the lightweight body sensor nodes. In this paper, We have proposed a trust management model based on Naive Bayes classifier to classify a sensor node as trustworthy or malicious. Based on the classification the trustor node will choose a trustee node for the exchange of data. We have trained our proposed model in MATLAB and experimental results show that the proposed model can successfully classify a sensor node as a malicious or trusted.},
